# The first time you generate the embeddings it may take a while (approximately 20 seconds) for the API to return them. We use the retry decorator (install with pip install retry) so 
# that if on the first try output = query(dict(inputs = texts)) doesn't work, wait 10 seconds and try again three times. The reason this happens is because on the first request, the model needs to be downloaded and installed in the server, but subsequent calls are much faster.
